General:
    SIM800 GSM Module (for SMS and GPRS communication).
    NEO-6MV2 GPS Module (for GPS functionality).
    ESP-12F ESP8266 (as the microcontroller for managing GPS and GSM data).
    3.7V 1800mAh Lithium-Ion Battery (or larger capacity for extended runtime).

Voltage Regulator:
    AMS1117 3.3V (to step down the 3.7V to 3.3V for the ESP8266 and GPS module).
    LM2596 Buck Converter (optional, for more efficient voltage regulation).

Capacitors:
    100µF electrolytic capacitor (for stabilizing the power supply to SIM800).
    0.1µF ceramic capacitor (to filter noise on power lines).

Resistors:
    10kΩ pull-up resistor for the TX/RX lines, if required for stable UART communication.
    Voltage divider resistors (e.g., 10kΩ and 20kΩ) for level shifting between 5V and 3.3V.

Diodes:
    Schottky diode (e.g., 1N5819) to prevent reverse current.

MOSFET:
    IRLZ44N (Logic-Level MOSFET):
